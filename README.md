# Asteroid Radar App

This is an app that get asteroids data from NASA API.
I developed it as the 2nd project for Udacity Android-Kotlin Nanodegree.

## Note
NASA API need api Key that you can generate from https://api.nasa.gov/
please generate your own key and put it in its place
in API_KEY constant val in constants file in utils folder
to be able to run the app.
